It all happened so suddenly without the slightest warning.
The day we first met, the first time we talked to each other, and how I felt when our lips first met...
All of those memories were still fresh within my heart.
There's no doubt that we will always be together, forever.

@[Reo]
"Hiaaaa!?"

@[Mai]
"Reo? What's the matter?"

@[Reo]
"That's what I should be asking you! Stupid Mai!"

@[Mai]
"What?"

@[Reo]
"W-What do you think you're doing all of a sudden!?"

@[Mai]
"What do you mean, "What am I doing"..."
I pondered why she said that with my eyes fixed intently on her.
This was the room where I, Sawaguchi Mai, had been living in ever since I was born.
And the person here with me is Kawamura Reo.
She just recently became my lover.
Speaking of which, it's Sunday today and Reo has been staying over at my place since yesterday.
"Is there something bothering you?"

@[Reo]
"Of course there is!!""
She yelled out in an uncomfortable-looking position.

@[Mai]
"Gosh, Reo, you sure like throwing tantrums all the time..."
As I spoke, I landed a kiss on Reo's pale white skin.

@[Reo]
"Hiuu... Mai... Hahn!"

@[Mai]
"Hmmm..."

@[Reo]
"Fue..."

@[Mai]
"You're in a pretty erotic position, aren't you?"

@[Reo]
"Wha!?"
"You're the one who put me in it!"

@[Mai]
"Well, yeah, that's true, but..."

@[Reo]
"Do you really think I don't feel embarrassed like this?!"
"But...since I...lo-love you, so..."
Reo spoke sheepishly.
Her words were like a speeding baseball plunging straight into the catcher within my chest.

@[Mai]
"Reooo!  "

@[Reo]
"Hyau!?!"
"Hey! Don't go hugging my thighs like that!""

@[Mai]
"Ufufu~ They're so soft and cute"

@[Reo]
"Aah! Hauu, ah, stop it..."

@[Mai]
"Reo... You're so cute..."

@[Reo]
"You dummy...stop...aah..."

@[Mai]
"Geez, even at times like these, all you ever do is get mad at me, Reo."

@[Reo]
"Nna... O-Of course not! I got mad because you pushed me down all of a sudden!"

@[Mai]
"Oh? But it's completely natural for us to do this, isn't it?"

@[Reo]
"Natural my foot! I was diligently studying, you know!"

@[Mai]
"And there I was beside you, diligently staring at the side of your face."

@[Reo]
"So you weren't studying?!"

@[Mai]
"Nope. You were so cute, it was like you're begging me to give you a hug. And that's how we ended up like this."

@[Reo]
"Geez! That's why I said you're so unreasonable!"

@[Mai]
"I guess, but what's important now is expressing our love, right? *lick*"

@[Reo]
"Nnah!? L-Like I said, you're...nn...being too sudden...hahn!"

@[Mai]
"But you seem to have another opinion down here...."

@[Reo]
"Hii, a, aa... Nkh...uuuhnn!"

@[Mai]
"Fufu, so you're not denying it? After all that fuss you made..."

@[Reo]
"Ah, aah...that's because...you're licking me in such an indecent place...ha...I don't have the strength..."
"Nggh... Once this is over...I'm definitely breaking up with you, you got that..."

@[Mai]
"Aw man, if you say that, I won't let you come ever again, you know? *chupu*"

@[Reo]
"Hyan!? Wait... Mai..."

@[Mai]
"It's tough, right? Even though your pussy's twitching so much, you can't come..."

@[Reo]
"Hah, hah... Aah! If you know that, then... Nn... Li...me..."

@[Mai]
"I can't hear you... Oh, do you want me to lick your pussy?"

@[Reo]
"Hah... Nghh..."
While biting her lips, Reo nodded her head.
She's so cute every single time she behaves like this. I can't get enough of it.
"Nna... Aa...fuaah, hiiuuu!"

@[Mai]
"*chu, chu*"
"Reo, try saying it out loud...nn... What does your pussy wants me to do to it? "

@[Reo]
"Nn... I can't...it's too embarrassing... Haa, I can't say it!"

@[Mai]
"Then should I just keep on using my fingers?"

@[Reo]
"N-No!"
"Use your...mouth on my pussy..."

@[Mai]
"Say that louder. Otherwise, you'll have to say bye-bye to these fingers too."

@[Reo]
"M-My pussy! Suck on my pussy with your mouth!"

@[Mai]
"Fufu, well said"

@[Reo]
"Uu...nghh... This is so embarrassing..."

@[Mai]
"But, you're still going to break up with me after I let you come, huh?"

@[Reo]
"I take it back..."
"Ngh... Ah... Nfu... Mai! Hurry up...nn!"

@[Mai]
"Alright, then... I'll suck it for you as much as I ca"
"*chumu*"

@[Reo]
"Aaah, Mai! Yes, you're making me feel so good..."

@[Mai]
"Haa... Do you want me to make you feel even better?"

@[Reo]
"Yeah... But...hah...before you can do that... Aah, I think I'm going to come."
"Hyan! Hahn...right there...is really... amazing... Nnaaahh, aah, nn!"
"Being licked by you...hah...makes me feel lightheaded...hah... I think I might go crazy...nngh\"
As I rolled the tip of my tongue around her sensitive clitoris, her wild breathing made her chest inflate and deflate violently.
To see her in so much pleasure made me feel really happy.
I started kissing her private area more aggressively.

@[Mai]
"*chupuu* *lick, chupa!*"

@[Reo]
"Kyaun! Nn...fua, aah...hiahn! Ah...hauuhn... nnn!"
"Ah...nnahh! Uu, nnhh...haah, hiahh! I'm... really going to come... Aaah!"

@[Mai]
"Go on, come..."

@[Reo]
"Ah, aah...but, but...nnaaaah! I'm...I'm coming!!"
Reo squinted her eyes roughly, as if she was bracing from the immense pleasure approaching.
Her love juices squirted out, shooting onto my face and wetting her swollen clitoris.
"Hiaaahn!"

@[Mai]
"Nhahn!"

@[Reo]
"Ah, haahn... Fuu...aah..."

@[Mai]
"Looks like you did it again, Reo."

@[Reo]
"Huh....did what?"

@[Mai]
"*giggle* Squirting, of course"

@[Reo]
"Wh... Whaaaat!?"

@[Mai]
"Looks like you squirted again... It's so cute, and your juices look so delicious."

@[Reo]
"Stooop! Licking it is absolutely off limits, you got that?!"

@[Mai]
"Why? Just a while ago, you were begging me to lick your pussy."

@[Reo]
"That was then! This is now! I said no means no!!"

@[Mai]
"Why? Pleaase, Reo~"

@[Reo]
"Hmph! Absolutely not!"

@[Mai]
"No matter what?"

@[Reo]
"No matter what!"

@[Mai]
"Even if I do this?"

@[Reo]
"Uu... E-Even if you do that...it's still no!"

@[Mai]
"Uu~ Reo..."

@[Reo]
"Hmph!"
Even after I tried giving her a tight hug, Reo wouldn't change her mind.
Looks like I'm the only one still horny, which feels kinda lonely...
"You got me to say all those embarrassing things, remember? So you better hold in your urges to lick it."

@[Mai]
"Hmm...but I'm a person consumed by lust, I don't think I'll be able to."
"Come to think of it, I got to taste a bit when you were climaxing."

@[Reo]
"What!? Geez.... I can't believe you."

@[Mai]
"Are you mad?"

@[Reo]
"No, I'm just feeling a little insecure."

@[Mai]
"Why?"

@[Reo]
"Because...t-that was squirting, right?"

@[Mai]
"Yeah."

@[Reo]
"I thought if it tasted bad, you might end up disliking me."

@[Mai]
"Hehehe, don't worry, it tasted really goo"

@[Reo]
"R-Really!?"

@[Mai]
"Yup, enough to make me want seconds."

@[Reo]
"Uu.... That's a bit worrying."

@[Mai]
"Fufu, with you being so adorable, it's worrying for me too"

@[Reo]
"Hawawa! Geeez... I said, stop hugging me so tight so suddenly."
"You...you might make me fall even deeper in love with you...."

@[Mai]
"Hm? Did you say something?"

@[Reo]
"N-Nothing!"

@[Mai]
"Really?"
Reo's cheeks suddenly turned bright red.
I wonder if it has something to do with what she muttered a few seconds ago.
"Hey Reo, what'd you just..."

@[Reo]
"Ahchoo! Mai, don't you feel a little cold?"

@[Mai]
"Huh? Well, yeah... Now that you mention it, I guess I am."
I tightened my embrace around Reo.

@[Reo]
"Hyaauuu!?"

@[Mai]
"What's wrong?"

@[Reo]
"Y-Your body is freezing!"

@[Mai]
"Ah... That's because my body gets cold easily."

@[Reo]
"Hauuu! I-I'm going to get frozen~! "

@[Mai]
"Fufu~ Your body is toasty warm, Reo""

@[Reo]
"Hyaauuuuu\!?"
"Don't touch my boobs with your cold hands!"

@[Mai]
"You say that, but look at how happy you are~"

@[Reo]
"Hiuuuuu, uu... I'm happy, but... I mean, I'm not happy..."

@[Mai]
"See, you're getting goosebumps... You must be really happy, huh?"

@[Reo]
"Well, I am happy, but... I mean, I'm not happy at all!"
Puffing out her flushed cheeks, Reo shouted at me.
Oh man, the neighbors might have heard that.
But even so, I didn't let her go and continued to hug her for a long time.

@[Mai]
"Reo, I love you"
Although it's fairly warm outside, this season is still a bit too cold for so little clothing.
We quickly put on our clothes and sat down on a bed and chair separately.
Reo was resting her chin in her hands, pouting.

@[Reo]
"Hmph\"

@[Mai]
"What's wrong? "

@[Reo]
"Mai, you're being really mean lately."

@[Mai]
"Oh, I doubt that."

@[Reo]
"It's almost like you take delight in bullying me."

@[Mai]
"T-That's not true!"

@[Reo]
"I wonder..."
Maybe I have gone overboard with the teasing in those moments when she's being so adorable that I couldn't hold back.
Time to reflect for a bit.
But more importantly, I should do something about Reo's gloomy mood.
Let's try looking for something fun to talk about.
Something fun...something fun... When I thought about places to have fun, the word " pool" sprung to mind.

@[Mai]
"Oh, that's right! It's almost summer vacation, right?"

@[Reo]
"Huh?"
My abrupt change of subject brought a confused expression upon Reo's face.
"Why are you talking about summer vacation when Golden Week hasn't even passed yet?"
"Is it summer in your head all year long?"
Ack, now that she mentions it.

@[Mai]
"But it's something I'm really looking forward to."
"Plus I want to see you more lightly dressed"

@[Reo]
"...You're a bully and a pervert."

@[Mai]
"Guha!"
She called me a pervert.
"W-Well, since you're dating a pervert, you must be one too, right?"

@[Reo]
"Uu."

@[Mai]
"Anyway, I'm sure looking forward to summer vacation."

@[Reo]
"..."
Reo let out a sigh of resignation.
"Sigh..."
Even though she's still giving me a disapproving glare, she stopped calling me a bully.

@[Mai]
"We're going to spend this summer together, right?"

@[Reo]
"...Well, yeah."

@[Mai]
"How do you usually spend your summer break every year?"

@[Reo]
"At my villa."
What, did she just say "villa"?

@[Mai]
"Vi-vi-vi...villa, eh... I'm jealous."

@[Reo]
"...Is that so?"

@[Mai]
"So like, in Karuizawa or something?"

@[Reo]
"Yeah."

@[Mai]
"You're totally as rich as I imagined you to be."

@[Reo]
"But I'm not sure if I'll go or not this year."
"Since Mama just divorced not long ago, she probably wouldn't have time for it."

@[Mai]
"Ahh..."
Come to think of it, her parents just got a divorce.
That was insensitive of me to bring it up...
"Well, even if you left for your villa, I'd be lonely too, you know?"
"So let's have fun together this year. Like go to the pool or something."

@[Reo]
"A pool? Which hotel's pool?"

@[Mai]
"..."
"N-No, I meant a normal public pool."

@[Reo]
"Hoeh?"

@[Mai]
"What's with that clueless face of yours..."
"Are public gym pools not good enough for you?"

@[Reo]
"I-I didn't say they're not good enough..."
Maybe my expression was pressuring her or something. Reo looked a bit worried.
She started thinking about how she should answer my question.
"...It sounds like it'd be crowded."

@[Mai]
"Of course it'd be crowded. It's open for children to adults, so the place would be as packed as a stuffed sausage."

@[Reo]
"Sausage..."
Her chin looks about ready to slip off from her palms.
"Do girls our age all go there?"

@[Mai]
"Yeah, usually."
"Since it's cheap enough that we can pay with our allowances."

@[Reo]
"I see, so that's how it feels like."
"Well... I don't mind wherever it is."

@[Mai]
"You're willing to go have fun with me?"

@[Reo]
"If you say you really want me to go no matter what, I'll consider it."

@[Mai]
"I really want you to go"

@[Reo]
"..."
"I guess I have no choice."

@[Mai]
"I'm looking forward to it!"
"Reo, can you swim?"

@[Reo]
"..."
"..."

@[Mai]
"What does that silence mean?"
"Ah, so you're a hammer!"

@[Reo]
"Ngh..."

@[Mai]
"Mm-hmm, that's so like you."

@[Reo]
"I can swim if I have a swimming tube, so who cares?"

@[Mai]
"If you start to drown, I'll save you, so don't worry."

@[Reo]
"I won't go anywhere I might drown, so I'll be fine."

@[Mai]
"But your legs might cramp while you're in the pool, you know?"

@[Reo]
"I have a swimming tube, so I'll be fine."

@[Mai]
"In that case, why can't you go where your feet can't reach the floor?"

@[Reo]
"It's scary, so I don't want to."
Her logic was filled with immense contradictions.

@[Mai]
"*sigh* I guess that's how our Reo is, huh?"
"By the way, what kind of swimsuit do you wear?"

@[Reo]
"Those white ones with frills on them."

@[Mai]
"Uwaah..."
Just imagining it almost gave me a nosebleed.

@[Reo]
"Got a problem with it?"

@[Mai]
"No, not at all."
"Rather, I want you to stay exactly as you are now with that swimsuit."

@[Reo]
"..."

@[Mai]
"I'm so looking forward to going to the pool with you."
"I hope there will be lots of exciting accidents waiting for us."

@[Reo]
"What's that supposed to mean?"

@[Mai]
"Like, you'd be swimming with an swimming tube, but someone could bump into you and make you fall into the water."

@[Reo]
"Don't say such unlucky things."

@[Mai]
"Of course, I'll rescue you, but then a bigger problem arises when you swallow too much water and lose consciousness!"

@[Reo]
"Why does that have to happen to me?"

@[Mai]
"I desperately perform artificial respiration on you!"
"And then after you come to, you'd return the favor with a kis"

@[Reo]
"I-I would never do something so embarrassing!"

@[Mai]
"By then, a lovey-dovey atmosphere will form between us."
"Unable to control our passion, we'll do "synchronized swimming of love" in the locker room!"
"Our duet gets the highest score"
"Everyone is envious of our deep love for each other..."

@[Reo]
"Wh-Wh-Wha..."

@[Mai]
"And that's how you'll become my love slave..."

@[Reo]
"I will not!"
"What the hell are you thinking about, you delusional girl?!"

@[Mai]
"Our sweet summer vacation plans, of course."

@[Reo]
"Stop having weird delusions about me!"

@[Mai]
"I can't! The delusions just won't stop"

@[Reo]
"Ngh, uuu~~!"
"Mai you idioottt!!"
Reo's shout resounded throughout the room.
Even her angered yelling is like pleasant music to my ears.
I'm sure I'm like this because I love her so much..
I love her so much that I can hardly control myself.

@[Mai]
"I hope summer vacation would hurry up."

@[Reo]
"I hope it will it never come."

@[Mai]
"Oh you, silly Reo."

@[Reo]
"That's not something you should be laughing about!"
She's totally in fumes.
Oh, why is my lover just so damn cute?
Sometimes, I really can't help but feel troubled by i
