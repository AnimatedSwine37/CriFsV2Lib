CriFsV2Lib Reloaded
===========

A minimal library to extract contents from CRI Middleware's CPK archive format. (a.k.a. CRI Filemajik library)

Goals:  
- Clean codebase.  
- Minimalist.  (does minimal amount of work)
- No dependencies.  (entirely self contained in ~25KB library)
- High performance.  (really, really fast)

I wrote this library for my personal needs (i.e. for use with [CriFs.V2.Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/CriFs.V2.Hook.ReloadedII) extensions).  
Does not support packing/repacking; if you need that functionality, fire a pull request üòá.  

What this library isn't:  
- General CRI Table Parser  (it skips any data it doesn't care about)

Feature Support
===============

- Decompression (CRILayla).  
- Header Decryption.  
- Custom User Decryption Functions.  

![WPF Application](./docs/images/gui.png)

A basic standalone WPF application is also available for testing.

Usage
=====

High Level API is available in the `CpkHelper` class.  

## Get File Info  
```csharp
using var fileStream = new FileStream(Assets.SampleCpkFile, FileMode.Open);
var files = CpkHelper.GetFilesFromStream(fileStream);
```

## Extract Individual File  
```csharp
using var file = CpkHelper.ExtractFile(files[0], fileStream)
// Access via file.Span
```

You can pass in optional decryption function.  
Lower level APIs will require partial understanding of the formats, have a look at the tests project.  

## Extract Files in Batch

The batch extractor can be used to efficiently extract multiple files in a multithreaded fashion.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Uses heavy array pooling, risk of address space starvation in 32-bit processes!!  

```csharp
using var extractor = new BatchFileExtractor<ItemModel>(CpkPath);
for (int x = 0; x < files.Length; x++)
    extractor.QueueItem(new CpkFileExtractorItemModel(Path.Combine(folder, files[x].FullPath), files[x]));

extractor.WaitForCompletion();
```

## Clearing Memory

‚ùó The library makes use of array pooling to speed up operations.  

Once you are done with using the library, consider clearing the array pool:  
```csharp
ArrayRental.Reset();
```

This will clear the pool, allowing the memory to be freed.  

üìù You might notice a large Private Working Set (RAM Usage) in Task Manager persisting for a while when running with GC Regions (.NET 7).  
*This is as intended and is not something you should be worried about*.  

This memory of the UOH (LOH and POH) will be fully decommitted when the GC sees fit, (usually after next Gen 2 GC or when a low RAM notification is received from the OS).  

If this however still bothers you, or you know you're not going to use the library again, request a GC with pressure:  
```csharp
GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode = GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.CompactOnce;
GC.AddMemoryPressure(int.MaxValue);
GC.Collect(); // will clean up LOH
GC.RemoveMemoryPressure(int.MaxValue);
// Memory will be fully decommitted shortly after this line (next GC of any kind)
```

Performance
===========

Some parts of this library are heavily tuned for performance. 

Decompression (CRILayla, 165KiB Model file):

Is approximately 15 times faster than the in retail CRI games.


Parsing a 30GB encrypted/scrambled CPK with 45000 files:  
```csharp

```

[`CriPak` is the reference implementation from [CriPakTools](https://github.com/wmltogether/CriPakTools)].  

In practice, this library is always I/O (/FileSystem) bottlenecked.  
6 cores of a modern CPU should be sufficient to saturate a modern NVMe SSD ()>3GB/s disk speed).
