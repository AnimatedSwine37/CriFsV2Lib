CriFsV2Lib Reloaded
===========

A library to extract contents from CRI Middleware's CPK archive format. (a.k.a. CRI Filemajik library)

Goals:  
- Clean codebase.  
- Trimmable dependencies.  (min code used after Assembly Trimming)
- High performance.  

I wrote this library for my personal needs (i.e. for use with [CriFs.V2.Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/CriFs.V2.Hook.ReloadedII) extensions).  
Does not support packing/repacking; if you need that functionality, fire a pull request ðŸ˜‡.  

Usage

Coming Soon.
